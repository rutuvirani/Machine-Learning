    "- Add and adapt your regression code (using numpy, not sklearn) from the previous exercise, so that is can predict the class label for each sample. This means, we treat the class of a point (0 or 1) as the target value of the regression. The linear regression will then yield us a formula that can give each (x, y) location a score, which class it might belong to. It's not a probability because it does not need to be between 0 and 1, but we can interpret a value being nearer to 0 as a higher probability for the class 0, and a value being nearer to 1 as a higher probability for class 1.\n",
    "- Perform a classification of the dataset using the regression formula. That means, assign the class 0 to data points that have a regression 'score' that is nearer to 0 than to 1, and assign the class 1 to the other points. Visualize the learned classification with matplotlib by coloring each (x, y) pair in the dataset with a color that depends on your classification (e.g. yellow for class 0, blue for class 1).\n",

    "- After you have done the iris classification exercise, print out the [classification_report](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.metrics.classification_report.html) using sklearn for this binary classification task. Then, plot the precision-recall curve using [precision_recall_curve](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.metrics.precision_recall_curve.html#sklearn.metrics.precision_recall_curve) and matplotlib\n",
    "- Additional Task: After you have done all the above, write your own code to calculate the metrics shown in classification_report and use that code to generate the precision-recall curve manually."
